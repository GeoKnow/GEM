GEM
===
**GEM (Geospatial-semantic Exploration on the Move)** is a mobile spatial-semantic visualization and exploration tool that relies on [Mappify](https://github.com/GeoKnow/Mappify) and its components ([Jassa](https://github.com/GeoKnow/Jassa), [Facete](https://github.com/GeoKnow/Facete)) to offer a rich mobile experience while exploiting all strengths of Linked Data and further rise above the common mobile geospatial visualization limitations by relying on open, crowd-sourced and semantically linked information found in publicly available sources, such as the LOD Cloud. This information is loaded and filtered according to userâ€™s needs, on demand, in order to prevent maps from overpopulating.

How to deploy
---
GEM is an [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) / [Adobe Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) project. Automation and package dependency management are controlled via [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), respectively. Batch installation/update scripts are provided for both Unix-based and Windows operating systems (*bower-update.sh* and *bower-update.bat*), and the mobile application source code is easily compiled by simply executing the following command from the desired CLI:
```
cordova build <platform>
```
where *&lt;platform&gt;* can be any of the Cordova/Phonegap supported platforms (e.g. *android*). It is worth noting that the Phonegap equivalent of the Cordova command is *phonegap build \<platform\>*. To compile and deploy the application to the desired device, we execute:
```
cordova run <platform>
```
